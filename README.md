# JDaze
*Java graphic library -vaguely- inspired by Unity*

## Getting Started
The most easy way to include JDaze into your project is to use it as
an IntelliJ IDEA module.

You can use it even if you have another IDE, but the process may be
different, and it's up to you to discover how to do it.

### Prerequisites
You need to have [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
and a [Java JDK](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit) installed.

I would recommend to use git as it will allow you to keep your local copy of JDaze
 updated by doing `git pull`.

### Installing
Clone JDaze with your git client, or from command line by doing:

`git clone https://github.com/fc-dev/JDaze.git`

Add it as a module inside your IntelliJ IDEA project by opening the `Project Structure`

Add a dependency to JDaze to your project module.

That's it, you can now use the JDaze Engine by importing it into your classes.

## Coding with JDaze
### Documentation

## Issues
For every kind of bug you can signal it by opening an issue,
same goes for enhancement requests and for any kind of question.

Please try to read the documentation before asking questions in the Issues,
that's meant as a last resort in case the documentation
on a subject is not very clear. 

## Contributing
To fix a bug/implement a feature you can fork the project and send a pull request.

Pull requests that do not compile will be rejected so please... test your code before submitting it.
